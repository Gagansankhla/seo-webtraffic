        <h2>A World Beyond Plastic: The Need for Sustainable Alternatives</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic pollution is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Every
          year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, harming
          marine life and ecosystems. Single-use plastics, such as disposable
          cutlery, are a major contributor to this crisis. These items are often
          used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to decompose.
        </p>
        <h2>Delicious Innovation: What Sets Incredible Eats Apart</h2>
        <p>
          What makes Incredible Eats’ edible cutlery so unique? It’s not just

            strong enough to handle hot soups and hearty meals but naturally
            decomposes if not eaten, ensuring zero waste.
